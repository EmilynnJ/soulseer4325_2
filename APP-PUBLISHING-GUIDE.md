# SoulSeer App Publishing Guide

This guide provides instructions for preparing and submitting the SoulSeer app to various app stores and as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

## PWA Implementation

The following components have been implemented to support PWA functionality:

1. **Web App Manifest** (`public/manifest.json`)
   - Defines app metadata, icons, and appearance
   - Includes shortcuts for key app functions

2. **Service Worker** (`public/serviceWorker.js`)
   - Provides offline capability
   - Handles background sync
   - Manages cache for faster loading
   - Supports push notifications

3. **Offline Page** (`public/offline.html`)
   - Shown when the user is offline
   - Provides a graceful fallback experience

4. **Meta Tags** (in `client/index.html`)
   - Enhanced with PWA-specific meta tags
   - Configured for Apple devices
   - Includes social media sharing tags

## Required Assets

For a complete app store submission, you'll need to create the following assets and place them in the `public/app-publishing` directory:

### Icons
